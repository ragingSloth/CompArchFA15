the 32 1-bit output channels are expressed as a 32-bit word, and since the input is 1-bit the proper output can be thought of as the word genereated by shifting the input left n times where n is the decimal value of address. This results in the nth place taking the value of input and everything else as zeros, which is the desired behavior. This is possible because Verilog seems to interpret 1D vectors are there decimal value in certain contexts including this one. For this reason an address of 5'b11111 will cause the input to be shifted left 31 times, generating the word 32'b10000000000000000000000000000000 and so on.
