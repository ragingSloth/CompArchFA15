This test implements the following pseudocode function:

int counter = 15
int total = 200

while counter > 0
	if counter > total
	  total = total - counter
	else
	  total = total + counter
	counter--

store total in memory

Your end result will vary based on the values you use for the function. With the stated values, the result should be 80.
